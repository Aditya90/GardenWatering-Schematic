# Transistor as a switch resistor selection

## Preparation

The first steps when selecting a transistor as a switch is to make sure that the maximum ratings of the transistor and within the limits of your application.

For the TIP31C, I have the following values :

```
Ic 
Ib_max = 1A
Veb
Vce
Vcb
```

Next, we need to consider the effects of the load we are trying to control. Let us consider the circuit shown below :-

![Motor-Control-Schematic]()

In this case, let us consider the following values

```
Source Voltage, Vs = +5V
Resistance of the load, Rl = 200 ohm
For our application, we assume the maximum base current, Ib = 50mA
The voltage output from the micro pin, Vm = +3.3 Vcb
```

For the load, the required current draw for optimal power is 

```
Ic = Vs / Rl
   = 5/200 = 25 maA
```

Therefore, the minmum current gain
